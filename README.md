### african developer community &mdash; afridevcmty 
There are many talented software developers across the continent of Africa. The challenge however, is that many of the devs resident on the continent have very low visibility on the Internet. This project is an attempt to provide a browseable directory of developers resident in Africa. The goal is to help developers easily find collaborators and to help other parties find developers resident in Africa.
